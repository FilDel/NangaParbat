  Fermilab-Collider. Measurement of the transverse momentum distribution and total cross section of e+e- pair in the Z0 boson region (66 to 116 GeV) producedin PBAR P collisions at c.m. energy of 1800 GeV. The data were taken during the 1992 to 95 running period and have an integrated luminosity of 110 pb-1.
