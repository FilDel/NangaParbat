\textbf{notes on bin normalization in SIDIS fit}\\
\newline
We implement a normalization for every bin of our data. For SIDIS, data in the same bin are characterized by their value of $(x,Q^2,z)$.
Drell-Yan data instead are distinguished by their value of $m$.
Z data are simply separated by their experiment.
In total we have 464 bins for SIDIS, 20 for DY and 4 for Z data. In total our data are divided inn 488 bins ($n_bin$).
For the calculation of $\chi^2$ we want to use the following formula:
\begin{equation}
\chi^2=\sum_i^{n_{bin}} \sum_j^{n_i} \frac{\left(N_i\sigma_{th,ij}-\sigma_{exp,ij}\right)^2}{\Delta\sigma_ij^2}
\end{equation}

where $i$ denotes the bin considered,$n_i$ is the number of data in the $i$ bin and $N_i$ is the normalization that we want to apply.\\
This normalization are chosen in a way to minimize the contributions to $\chi^2$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \chi^2}{\partial N_i} = 0 
\end{equation}
We try to derive the explicit expression of $N_j$ for a specific bin $k$:
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \chi^2}{\partial N_j} &=  \sum_j^{n_k}\frac{\left(N_k\sigma_{th,kj}-\sigma_{exp,kj}\right)^2}{\Delta\sigma_k^2} = \\
 &=  \sum_j^{n_k} \frac{2\left( N_k\sigma_{th,kj}-\sigma_{exp,kj} \right)}{\Delta\sigma_k^2}\cdot \sigma_{th,kj} = 0
\end{align}
and we obtain the following expression to calculate $N_k$:
\begin{equation}
N_k= \frac{\sum_j^{n_k} \sigma_{exp,kj} }{\sum_j^{n_k} \sigma_{th,kj}}\,.
\end{equation}
