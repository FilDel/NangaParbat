comment: "CERN-LHC.  Measurements are presented of electroweak boson production using
  data from $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 8\\mathrm{\\,Te\\kern
  -0.1em V}$. The analysis is based on an integrated luminosity of $2.0\\mathrm{\\,fb}^{-1}$
  recorded with the LHCb detector. The bosons are identified in the $W\\rightarrow\\mu\\nu$
  and $Z\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decay channels. The cross-sections are measured
  for muons in the pseudorapidity range $2.0 < \\eta < 4.5$, with transverse momenta
  $p_{\\perp} > 20\\,$GeV$/c$ and, in the case of the $Z$ boson, a dimuon mass within
  $60 < M_{\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}} < 120\\;$GeV$/c^{2}$. The results are \n$$\n\\sigma_{W^{+}\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\nu}
  = 1093.6 \\pm 2.1 \\pm 7.2 \\pm 10.9 \\pm 12.7{\\rm \\,pb}\\; ,\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{W^{-}\\rightarrow\\mu^{-}\\bar{\\nu}}
  = 818.4 \\pm 1.9 \\pm 5.0 \\pm 7.0 \\pm 9.5{\\rm \\,pb} \\, ,\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{Z\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}}
  = 95.0 \\pm 0.3 \\pm 0.7 \\pm 1.1 \\pm 1.1{\\rm \\,pb} \\, ,\n$$\nwhere the first
  uncertainties are statistical, the second are systematic, the third are due to the
  knowledge of the LHC beam energy and the fourth are due to the luminosity determination.
  The evolution of the $W$ and $Z$ boson cross-sections with centre-of-mass energy
  is studied using previously reported measurements with $1.0$ fb$^{-1}$ of data at
  $7\\,$TeV. Differential distributions are also presented. Results are in good agreement
  with theoretical predictions at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum
  chromodynamics.\n"
