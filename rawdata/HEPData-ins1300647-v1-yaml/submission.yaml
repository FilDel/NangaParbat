comment: |
  CERN-LHC. This paper describes a measurement of the Z/GAMMA* boson transverse momentum spectrum, using proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV collected during 2011 by ATLAS at the LHC. The measurement is performed in the Z/GAMMA* --> E+ E- and Z/GAMMA* --> MU+ MU- channels, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb^{-1}.  Normalized differential cross sections as a function of the Z/GAMMA* boson transverse momentum, PT(Z), are measured for transverse momenta up to 800 GeV. The measurement is performed inclusively for Z/GAMMA* rapidities, YRAP(Z), up to 2.4, as well as in three rapidity bins.

  The measured normalized cross section (1/SIG(FID))*D(SIG(FID))/DPT(Z) at the Born level in bins of PT(Z) for the Z/GAMMA* --> E+ E- and Z/GAMMA* --> MU+ MU- channels, and correction factors to the bare- and dressed-level cross sections. The relative statistical and total uncorrelated systematic uncertainties are given for each channel as well as the correlated systematic uncertainties.
