comment: |
  CERN-LHC.  Distributions of transverse momentum $p_T^{ll}$ and the angular variable $\phi^*_\eta$ of Drell--Yan lepton pairs are measured in 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of proton--proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Measurements in electron-pair and muon-pair final states are corrected for detector effects and combined in a fiducial region in which the two leptons are required to have $p_{T}>20$ GeV and $|\eta|<2.4$. Compared to previous measurements in proton--proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, these new measurements benefit from a larger data sample and improved control of systematic uncertainties. Measurements are performed in bins of lepton-pair mass above, around and below the Z-boson mass peak.

  UPDATE 13/06/2016: The README in the attached tarball was modified to explain the reason for a small difference between the central values of the normalised $p_T^{\ell\ell}$ distributions given in the main HEPDATA entry and those in the raw combination output given in the tarball.

  Fiducial cross sections at Born level in the electron- and muon-pair channels as well as the combined value. The statistical and systematic uncertainties are given as a percentage of the cross section. An additional uncertainty of 2.8% on the integrated luminosity, which is fully correlated between channels and among all $m_{\ell\ell}$ bins, pertains to these measurements. The individual uncertainty sources after the combination are not necessarily orthogonal and also do not include uncertainties uncorrelated between bins of $m_{\ell\ell}$. Therefore their quadratic sum may not give the total systematic uncertainty.
