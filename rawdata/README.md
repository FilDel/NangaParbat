## Raw datasets

This folder contains the raw data files as downloaded from
[HepData](https://www.hepdata.net). The relevant files have to be
preprocessed to format them suitably to be used for the production of
the interpolation grids and the fits. The name of the subfolders
identifies the dataset through an ID code used in HepData. Here is the
list of IDs along with the dataset to which it referes and respective
link to HepData page:
