# Short descrition of the fit that will appear in the report of the
# fit
Description: "Test fit with the Davies-Webber-Stirling parameterisation."

# Minimiser to be used for the fit. Possible options so far are
# 'minuit', 'ceres', and 'none'.
Minimiser: minuit

# Parameterisation to be fitted to data. This has to correspond to a
# derivarion of the "Parameterisation" class.
Parameterisation: DWS

# Cut on qT / Q. This has to be smaller than the production cut used
# to produce the tables.
qToQmax: 0.2

# Seed used with the random-number generator for the generation of the
# Monte Carlo replicas
Seed: 1234

# Set of parameters to be used to compute the t0 predictions for the
# treatment of normalisation uncertantities. They have to be as many
# and ordered as the "Parameters" below.
t0parameters: [0.01, 0.1]

# List of parameters to be fitted to data. This requires that the
# number and order of parameters matches those expected by the
# particular parameterisation being used.
Parameters:
  - {name: "$g_1$", starting_value: 0.01, step: 0.001, fix: false}#, lower_bound: 0, upper_bound: 10}
  - {name: "$g_2$", starting_value: 0.1,  step: 0.005, fix: false}#, lower_bound: 0, upper_bound: 10}
