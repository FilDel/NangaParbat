# Short description of the fit that will appear in the report of the
# fit
Description: "Test fit with the Davies-Webber-Stirling parameterisation."

# Minimiser to be used for the fit. Possible options so far are
# 'minuit', 'ceres', and 'none'.
Minimiser: minuit

# Seed used with the random-number generator for the generation of the
# Monte Carlo replicas
Seed: '1234'

# Cut on qT / Q. This has to be smaller than the production cut used
# to produce the tables.
qToQmax: '0.2'

# Cut on the error function value for the selection of the "good"
# Monte Carlo replicas.
Error function cut: '4'

# Enable or disable the t0 prescription for the treatment of
# normalisation uncertantities and define the set of parameters to be
# used to compute the corresponding predictions (used only if the t0
# prescriprion is enabled). They have to be as many and ordered as the
# "Parameters" below.
t0prescription: true
t0parameters: [0.207309505279, 0.09258432985738]

# Parameterisation to be fitted to data. This has to correspond to a
# derivarion of the "Parameterisation" class.
Parameterisation: DWS

# Fluctuate initial parameters according to their step
Paramfluct: false

# List of parameters to be fitted to data. This requires that the
# number and order of parameters matches those expected by the
# particular parameterisation being used.
